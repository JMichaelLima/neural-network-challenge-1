## Requirements

Prepare the Data for Use on a Neural Network Model
Two datasets were created: a target (y) dataset, which includes the "credit_ranking" column, and a features (X) dataset, which includes the other columns. 

The features and target sets have been split into training and testing datasets.

Scikit-learn's StandardScaler was used to scale the features data. 

Compile and Evaluate a Model Using a Neural Network
A deep neural network was created with appropriate parameters. 

The model was compiled and fit using the accuracy loss function, the adam optimizer, the accuracy evaluation metric, and a small number of epochs, such as 50 or 100. 

The model was evaluated using the test data to determine its loss and accuracy. 

The model was saved and exported to a keras file named student_loans.keras.

Predict Loan Repayment Success by Using your Neural Network Model 
The saved model was reloaded.

The reloaded model was used to make binary predictions on the testing data. 

A classification report is generated for the predictions and the testing data. 

## Discuss creating a recommendation system for student loans
For Question 1:

The response describes the data that should be collected to build a recommendation system for student loan options.

The response explains why they think that data should be collected.

The type of data described is appropriate for a recommendation system for student loan options.

For Question 2:

The response chose a filtering method.

The student justified the choice of their filtering method.

The choice of filtering method was appropriate for the data selected in the previous question.

For Question 3:

The response lists two real-world challenges with building a recommendation system for student loans.

The response explains why these challenges would be of concern for a student loan recommendation system.
